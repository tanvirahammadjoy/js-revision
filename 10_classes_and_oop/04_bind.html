    // ** Bind key word explain

    // Problem Scenario:
    // You are developing a shopping cart feature for an e-commerce website. You need to ensure that when users click a button to add an item to their cart, the correct item is added, and the this keyword within the event handler points to the specific product instance. However, you notice that the this keyword inside the event handler is losing its context and referring to the button element instead of the product.

    // You decide to use the bind() method to ensure that this in the event handler correctly refers to the product object.

    // Example Code Without bind():
    function Product(name, price) {
      this.name = name;
      this.price = price;
    }

    Product.prototype.addToCart = function () {
      console.log(this.name + " has been added to the cart!");
    };

    const phone = new Product("Smartphone", 500);
    const laptop = new Product("Laptop", 1000);

    // Event listeners
    const addPhoneBtn = document.getElementById("addPhone");
    const addLaptopBtn = document.getElementById("addLaptop");

    addPhoneBtn.addEventListener("click", phone.addToCart);
    addLaptopBtn.addEventListener("click", laptop.addToCart);

    // In this code, when you click the "Add to Cart" button, the this keyword inside the addToCart method refers to the button itself (because the event listener changes the context of this), not the phone or laptop object.

    // Issue:
    // Clicking the "Add Phone" button logs: undefined has been added to the cart! because this refers to the button, not the phone object.
    // Solution Using bind():
    // The bind() method allows you to explicitly bind the this keyword to a specific object, ensuring it doesn't lose context when passed as a callback function.

    // Updated Code with bind():

    function Product(name, price) {
      this.name = name;
      this.price = price;
    }

    Product.prototype.addToCart = function () {
      console.log(this.name + " has been added to the cart!");
    };

    const phone1 = new Product("Smartphone", 500);
    const laptop1 = new Product("Laptop", 1000);

    // Event listeners with bind()
    const addPhoneBtn1 = document.getElementById("addPhone");
    const addLaptopBtn1 = document.getElementById("addLaptop");

    // Bind 'this' to the specific product
    addPhoneBtn.addEventListener("click", phone.addToCart.bind(phone));
    addLaptopBtn.addEventListener("click", laptop.addToCart.bind(laptop));

    // Explanation of bind():
    // The bind() method creates a new function with the this keyword permanently set to the object you pass to bind().
    // In this case, phone.addToCart.bind(phone) ensures that the this inside the addToCart method always refers to the phone object, even when the function is called as an event handler.
    // How bind() Solves the Problem:
    // When you click the "Add Phone" button, this.name correctly refers to "Smartphone", and it logs: "Smartphone has been added to the cart!".
    // Similarly, clicking the "Add Laptop" button logs: "Laptop has been added to the cart!".
    // Summary:
    // The bind() method is a useful way to control the value of this inside functions, especially when passing methods as callbacks or event handlers, ensuring they maintain their intended context.

    // I want to understand the behind the scenes of this code and write this same code with within the class?

    // Behind the Scenes of the bind() Method:
    // When you use the bind() method, it creates a new function where the this keyword is permanently set to the value you pass to bind(). Behind the scenes, JavaScript handles functions as objects, and when you pass them to event handlers (like addEventListener), the this context is typically lost because the function is called in a different context (the button element in our example).

    // Here’s how bind() works step-by-step:

    // Original Context: When a method like addToCart is defined, the this inside that method refers to the instance of the object (e.g., phone or laptop).
    // Event Listener: When you pass phone.addToCart directly to addEventListener, the this reference changes to the button element (because it becomes a callback in a different execution context).
    // Using bind(): When you use phone.addToCart.bind(phone), you explicitly tell JavaScript that this should always refer to the phone object, regardless of how or where the function is called. The bind() method essentially returns a new version of the addToCart function, but with this locked to the object you specified.
    // Class-Based Code:
    // You can rewrite this code using the modern JavaScript class syntax. With ES6 classes, methods are defined inside the class, and you can still use bind() to ensure that this refers to the correct instance.

    // Here’s the code rewritten using a class:

    class Product {
      constructor(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
      }

      addToCart() {
        console.log(`${this.name} has been added to the cart!`);
      }
    }

    // Create instances of the Product class
    const phone3 = new Product("Smartphone", 500);
    const laptop3 = new Product("Laptop", 1000);

    // Get buttons from the DOM
    const addPhoneBtn2 = document.getElementById("addPhone");
    const addLaptopBtn3 = document.getElementById("addLaptop");

    // Event listeners with bind()
    addPhoneBtn2.addEventListener("click", phone.addToCart.bind(phone3));
    addLaptopBtn3.addEventListener("click", laptop.addToCart.bind(laptop3));

    // Explanation of the Class-Based Code:
    // class Product { ... }: This defines a class Product which is a template for creating product objects (like phone and laptop).
    // constructor(name, price): This is a special method that initializes new objects created from the Product class, setting the name and price properties.
    // addToCart(): This is a method inside the class, and it logs the name of the product to the console when called.
    // Binding this: The addToCart.bind(phone) ensures that this inside the method always refers to the phone object, even when called by the event listener.
    // Summary of bind():
    // The bind() method is important when working with event listeners or callbacks in JavaScript, as it guarantees that this inside your function will always refer to the object you intend. In this case, it ensures that when the addToCart() function is triggered by a button click, it behaves as if it were called directly on the object (phone or laptop). Using classes makes it easier to encapsulate behavior and properties for objects, following a more organized approach.

    // Now days do we use binds it’s not what we use in depth explain please with Behind the scenes what happening?

    // In modern JavaScript development, using bind() is less common, especially with the introduction of arrow functions and other features like class fields in ES6+. These alternatives provide a more intuitive and less error-prone way to handle this without the need to explicitly use bind().

    // Let's explore what’s happening behind the scenes, why bind() is used less today, and what alternatives are used instead.

    // Behind the Scenes of bind()
    // When we use bind(), a few key things happen:

    // 1. New Bound Function: bind() creates a new function that is a copy of the original, but with the this context permanently bound to the object you pass to bind(). It does not change the original function.
    // Example: const boundFunction = originalFunction.bind(someObject);
    // This means whenever you call boundFunction(), the this inside it will refer to someObject, no matter how or where it is called.
    // 2. Permanent this: Once the this value is bound using bind(), you can't rebind it. It’s locked to that context permanently.
    // 3. Performance Impact: Creating bound functions can have a small performance cost, especially if done repeatedly or in performance-critical situations, since each call to bind() generates a new function object.

    // Why bind() is Used Less Today

    // Arrow Functions:
    // Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, do not have their own this context. Instead, they lexically inherit this from the surrounding scope.
    // This solves the problem of this context changing, particularly in callbacks or event listeners, making bind() unnecessary in many situations.

    // Example:
    class Product {
      constructor(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
      }

      addToCart = () => {
        console.log(`${this.name} has been added to the cart!`);
      };
    }

    // const phone = new Product('Smartphone', 500);
    // const addPhoneBtn = document.getElementById('addPhone');
    // addPhoneBtn.addEventListener('click', phone.addToCart);
    // In this example, addToCart is an arrow function, so it naturally uses the this context of the instance (phone), without needing to bind() it manually.
    // Behind the Scenes: The arrow function doesn't have its own this. When the addToCart method is called, it uses the this from where it was defined, which is the phone object.
    // Class Fields:

    // With class fields (a more recent addition to JavaScript), you can directly define methods as properties in a class, which helps maintain the correct this context without bind().
    // This feature simplifies class-based code by automatically binding methods to the instance.
    // Example with Class Fields:

    class Product {
      name = "";
      price = 0;

      constructor(name, price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
      }

      addToCart = () => {
        console.log(`${this.name} has been added to the cart!`);
      };
    }

    const laptop2 = new Product("Laptop", 1000);
    const addLaptopBtn2 = document.getElementById("addLaptop");
    addLaptopBtn.addEventListener("click", laptop.addToCart);

    // In this example, the addToCart method is defined as a class field (using the = syntax), and it's already bound to the class instance, so no bind() is needed.
    // Event Delegation and this Context:

    // In many modern JavaScript frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular), you typically don't work directly with DOM event listeners and thus don't need to handle the this context manually. Instead, the framework takes care of binding the context automatically behind the scenes.
    // For example, in React, the this context is handled seamlessly, so you rarely need bind() or even worry about it in event handlers:

    class Product extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { name: "Smartphone" };
      }

      addToCart = () => {
        console.log(`${this.state.name} has been added to the cart!`);
      };

      render() {
        return <button onClick={this.addToCart}>Add to Cart</button>;
      }
    }

    // React handles the this context correctly because of how it deals with functions. This reduces the need for bind() in modern applications.
    // Alternatives to bind():
    // Arrow Functions: As discussed, arrow functions solve most this context issues because they inherit this from the parent scope.

    // Class Fields: Class properties (methods defined as fields) automatically bind this to the instance.

    // Function Parameter: Sometimes, instead of using bind(), you can pass the relevant object directly as an argument to the function and avoid dealing with this entirely.

    function addToCart(product) {
      console.log(`${product.name} has been added to the cart!`);
    }

    const phone2 = { name: "Smartphone", price: 500 };
    addPhoneBtn.addEventListener("click", () => addToCart(phone2));

    // Summary:
    // bind() is used less today because arrow functions and class fields offer more elegant ways to handle the this context.
    // Behind the Scenes: When bind() is used, it creates a new function with this permanently set to the specified object. This can lead to better control over this in event listeners and callbacks but at the cost of creating additional function objects.
    // Modern Alternatives: Arrow functions inherit this from their surrounding scope, eliminating the need for bind(), while class fields automatically bind methods to the instance.

    // Thus, while bind() is still available, it is less common in modern JavaScript thanks to these newer, more efficient features.
