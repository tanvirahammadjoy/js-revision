    // **    Event Object     ** //

    // Event Object in JavaScript: In-depth Details and Behind the Scenes
    // The Event Object in JavaScript is a fundamental part of handling and responding to events. Whenever an event occurs, an event object is automatically created and passed as a parameter to the event handler. This object contains essential information about the event itself, such as the type of event, the target element, the position of the event, key or mouse data, and more.

    // Key Properties and Methods of the Event Object
    // The event object has several important properties and methods that provide context and control over the event.

    // 1. type: Type of Event
    // The type property returns a string indicating the type of event that was triggered. It allows the developer to determine what specific event (click, mouseover, keydown, etc.) occurred.

    // 2. target: The Element that Triggered the Event
    // The target property references the DOM element that triggered the event. This is particularly useful when an event is attached to multiple elements, and you want to know which specific element fired the event.

    // 3. currentTarget: The Element with the Event Listener
    // The currentTarget property refers to the element to which the event handler is attached, not necessarily the element that triggered the event. This differs from target, which could be any descendant element of the currentTarget.

    // 4. preventDefault(): Preventing Default Behavior
    // The preventDefault() method stops the default action that belongs to the event. For instance, in a form submission, calling preventDefault() can prevent the form from being submitted.

    // 5. stopPropagation(): Stopping Event Propagation
    // The stopPropagation() method prevents further propagation of the event in the bubbling or capturing phases. This is helpful when you want to ensure that an event handler is triggered only once, or you don't want the event to propagate to parent elements.

    // 6. stopImmediatePropagation(): Stopping All Event Handlers
    // While stopPropagation() stops the event from propagating to parent elements, stopImmediatePropagation() stops any further event handlers from being triggered on the current element itself.

    // 7. eventPhase: Tracking the Phase of Event Propagation
    // The eventPhase property tells you in which phase of event propagation the event currently is. This value can be:

    // 1 for the capturing phase
    // 2 for the target phase
    // 3 for the bubbling phase

    // document.querySelector("div").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    //   console.log(`Event phase: ${event.eventPhase}`); // Will output 1, 2, or 3 based on the phase
    // });

    // 8. bubbles: Can the Event Bubble?
    // The bubbles property is a boolean that indicates whether the event is capable of bubbling up through the DOM or not. Not all events bubble (e.g., focus events do not).

    // document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    //   console.log(event.bubbles); // Output: true for a click event
    // });

    // 9. defaultPrevented: Was the Default Action Prevented?
    // The defaultPrevented property is a boolean that tells you if preventDefault() has been called on the event, effectively blocking the default action.

    // 10. clientX and clientY: Mouse Position Coordinates
    // For mouse-related events, clientX and clientY properties provide the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the mouse pointer, relative to the viewport (the visible area of the browser).

    // 11. key and keyCode: Key Press Information
    // For keyboard-related events, the key property returns the actual key value pressed, while keyCode (deprecated) provides the numeric code of the key.

    // ************* Event Delegation ********************** //

    // Event Delegation in JavaScript: In-depth Explanation
    // Event delegation is a pattern in JavaScript that allows us to handle events efficiently by taking advantage of event propagation (bubbling and capturing). Instead of attaching an event handler to multiple child elements, we attach a single event listener to a parent element. The listener catches events from child elements through event bubbling.

    // Key Benefits of Event Delegation:
    // Improved performance: Instead of adding multiple event listeners, we add one to the parent, reducing memory usage.
    // Dynamic content handling: Newly added elements (e.g., via JavaScript) are automatically handled by the parent’s event listener.
    // Simplified code: Fewer event listeners mean simpler and more maintainable code.

    // Example: Basic Event Delegation
    // Let’s say we have a list of items (<li>) within an unordered list (<ul>), and we want to handle clicks on each list item. Instead of adding an event listener to each <li>, we can attach one listener to the <ul> parent and use event delegation.

    // Select the parent element (ul)
    // const itemList1 = document.getElementById("itemList");

    // // Attach the event listener to the parent (ul) using event delegation
    // itemList1.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    //   // Check if the target is an <li> element
    //   if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    //     console.log(`You clicked on ${event.target.innerText}`);
    //   }
    // });

    // Explanation:
    // We attach the click event listener to the <ul> instead of each <li>.
    // When any of the <li> elements is clicked, the event bubbles up to the <ul>, which handles the event.
    // We use event.target to find the exact element that triggered the event (the clicked <li>).
    // How Event Delegation Works Behind the Scenes
    // Event Bubbling: When an event occurs on a child element, it starts at the target (in this case, an <li>) and bubbles up to its ancestors (like the <ul>, <div>, and eventually the document).

    // Single Event Handler: With event delegation, only one event handler is attached to the parent element (in our case, the <ul>). This handler catches all events that bubble up from its children.

    // event.target vs event.currentTarget:

    // event.target: The element where the event originally occurred (the actual <li> that was clicked).
    // event.currentTarget: The element to which the event listener is attached (the <ul>).
    // Efficiency: Adding a listener to each child element can be inefficient if there are many elements or if new elements are added dynamically. Event delegation allows handling new elements automatically without the need for reattaching listeners.

    // Example: Handling Dynamic Content with Event Delegation
    // // One of the major advantages of event delegation is its ability to handle dynamically created elements. Let’s say we want to add more <li> elements to the list dynamically and still handle clicks on them without needing to reassign event listeners.

    const itemList = document.getElementById("itemList");
    const addItemButton = document.getElementById("addItem");
    let itemCount = 4;

    // Event delegation: Handles clicks on existing and future <li> elements
    itemList.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
        console.log(`You clicked on ${event.target.innerText}`);
      }
    });

    // Dynamically add new <li> elements
    addItemButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
      const newItem = document.createElement("li");
      newItem.innerText = `Item ${itemCount}`;
      itemList.appendChild(newItem); // Adding a new <li>
      itemCount++;
    });
    // Explanation:
    // We add new <li> elements dynamically by clicking the "Add Item" button.
    // The click event on these new items is still handled because we are using event delegation on the parent <ul>.
    // There’s no need to reattach event listeners to the new <li> elements because the parent <ul>’s listener catches all events from its children.

    // Real-world Use Cases for Event Delegation
    // 1. Form Validation: If you have a long form with multiple input fields, instead of attaching a blur or input event listener to each field, you can delegate those events to a parent form element and handle validation for all fields in one place.
    document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("input", (event) => {
      if (event.target.tagName === "INPUT") {
        // Perform validation for input fields
        console.log(`Validating input: ${event.target.name}`);
      }
    });
    // 2. Menu Navigation: Event delegation is useful in cases like navigation menus, where each menu item has the same event (e.g., opening a submenu). Instead of adding separate listeners to each item, delegate the click event to the parent container.

    document.querySelector(".menu").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      if (event.target.classList.contains("menu-item")) {
        // Toggle submenu visibility
        event.target.querySelector(".submenu").classList.toggle("visible");
      }
    });

    // 3. Infinite Scrolling and Content Loading: When elements are dynamically loaded (e.g., in an infinite scrolling list), event delegation ensures that new items are handled automatically.

    // Potential Pitfalls and Considerations
    // 1. Performance Considerations: While event delegation can improve performance by reducing the number of event listeners, if used improperly (for example, attaching a global listener to document or body), it can cause unnecessary event handling and performance degradation.

    // 2. Specificity: Event delegation requires that you carefully check event.target to ensure that you're handling the correct element. Without proper filtering (e.g., checking event.target.tagName or using classList.contains()), you might handle unintended events.

    // 3. Non-bubbling Events: Not all events bubble (e.g., focus, blur), so event delegation can’t be used with those. For these events, listeners need to be added directly to the element that triggers the event.

    // Event Delegation vs Non-delegation Approach
    // Let’s look at a comparison between the two approaches:

    // Without Event Delegation:
    document.querySelectorAll("li").forEach((item) => {
      item.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log(`You clicked on ${item.innerText}`);
      });
    });

    // A separate event listener is added to each <li>, which increases memory usage.
    // Dynamically added elements won’t have event listeners unless you manually attach them again.
    // With Event Delegation:

    document.querySelector("ul").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
        console.log(`You clicked on ${event.target.innerText}`);
      }
    });

    // Only one listener is attached to the parent <ul>.
    // Dynamically added <li> elements are automatically handled by the parent’s event listener.
    // Conclusion:
    // Event delegation is a powerful technique for handling events efficiently, especially when dealing with a large number of child elements or dynamically generated content. By attaching a single event listener to a parent element and using event propagation, you can improve performance, reduce code complexity, and handle events for dynamically added elements seamlessly.
